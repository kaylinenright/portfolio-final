                <p class="process-title">Theme</p>
                <p class="process-p">The theme for the annual report for Cirque du Soliel is based around the idea of reviewing the entire year. The magical times that the company has seen and done all captured within one book. The concept was based upon a yearbook, many dates and event all wrapped into one. There are collages of multiple pictures to reinforce this idea, holding so many memories of the various performers all captured together.</p>
                
                <h3 class="process-title">Typography</h3>
                <p class="process-p">The font chosen for the book was ITC Avant Guarde, a san serif typeface used for the body copy. It is fun and casual, giving the book a relaxed tone. The typeface has a large family that varies in weight as well as a large x-height for good readability. The typeface paired with it was Baskerville, a serif font used for the titles and spot images. The typeface carries a professional tone, to liven it up I chose to set the headlines in small caps. This adds a touch of quark to the copy. Accenting colour of orange was also used through out the book to draw the eye to key information.</p>
                
        
<h3 class="process-title">Design</h3>
                <p class="process-p">As chose geometric shapes for the pattern of the book. This is based off the make and costumes worn by the performers who wear intricate patterns while on stage. Intricate squares were used as well as triangles to represent the tent tops of the circus. Full page dividers were used to break up the information, the design of the pages used a large amount of white space so on the dividers I flipped this creating a visual and clear sign the section was done. Icons were used to accompany quotes on the pages as an added way for readers to retain key information. This is also beneficial in a meeting because they would recap what the presenter is speaking of in a visual manner. This is also good for visual readers who have difficulties staying focused on long pages of words. The colour palette for the book was chosen off the translation of Cirque du Soliel, which means circus of the sun. I played off this theme and chose a warm colour palette that worked well together. Orange, yellow and red were chosen as the three colours carried throughout the book.</p>
