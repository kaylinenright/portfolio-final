            <p class="process-p">When choosing to redesign the layout, I chose to redesign it to a square shape. The previous plastic bag had very little shelf presence, having to be placed in a basket for it to stay on the shelf. The box shape was chosen to not only increase shelf display and reduce lost real estate, but you are able to notice it and actually see the product. There is a die cut on the front of the box allowing the consumer to see and inspect the soup mix. The cut out is in the shape of a pepper, hinting at one of the main ingredients in the product. The container contains two sections inside the box; this is for portion control. For those who do not have large families 4 portions of soup can be very overwhelming and a waste, dividing up the box for two servings per section decreases lost food. The sections are simple to open with the perforated top, the sealed sections ensure product freshness and an easier pour. The top of the box is attached to the back of the product so one never has to fret over losing the lid among cooking, as well as easier clean up later on.</p>

            <h3 class="process-title">Colour</h3>
            <p class="process-p">A distinct colour palette was chosen for the layout, the colours themselves were taken straight from the soup mix itself. Bringing the natural colouring of the spices into the packaging truly shows the consumer how wholesome and pure the product is. There is no artificial colouring added to the product, the quality produced from the company would rival that of how your grandmother used to make it. Warm tones were chosen for the colour palette to match the warm and filled feeling you receive after eating the soup. The colours themselves on the packaging all blend well together; the neutral earthy palette possesses a nice unity to the colours, allowing them to all work well together. The background colour to the package is a soft beige colour allowing the dark font to really pop off the page allowing great readability from the shelf.
            </p>


            <h3 class="process-title">Typography</h3>
            <p class="process-p">The font family for the layout chosen was ITC Avant Garde Gothic Std, a san-serif type family. It was chosen for it chosen for its casual and fun feel. The original packaging had a lively and modern feel to it and I wanted to carry this look over into the redesign of the packaging. The company has been around for over 100 years and they do not need to use flash or extravagance to persuade customers, their product is able to sell itself. The font has a large family ranging in font weights from thin to bold, as well as possessing a compressed version. ITC Avant Garde Gothic Std has a large x-height, maintaining readability from a distance on the shelf.
