title: Annuel Report- Cirque de Soliel
heading-1: Concept
para-1: The theme for the annual report for Cirque du Soliel is based around the idea of reviewing the entire year. The magical times that the company has seen and done all captured within one book. The concept was based upon a yearbook, many dates and events all wrapped into one. There are collages of multiple pictures to reinforce this idea, holding so many memories of the various performers all captured together. 
heading-2: Problems
para-2: Since the book was mainly being viewed by business professional, sponsors looking to donate their money to the company; annual reports are usual straightforward and dull. I wanted to make a report that showcased the passion and beliefs the company holds, to really show a sense of what the company stands for and why you should invest in them. 
heading-3: Colour
para-3: Throughout the book you see pops of colour and a splash of personality. I broke up the book into sizable parts to make it easier for people to follow along. Illustrations were used to accompany quotes on the pages as an added way for readers to retain key information, show casing the highlights of the company.

heading-4: Design Consideration
para-4: The geometric pattern and colours of the book are based off the performers costumes and makeup.  The border of the pages was inspired by the peaks of the tents. Page dividers were used to break up the information, the design of the pages used a large amount of white space so on the dividers I flipped this, creating a visual and clear sign the section was done. This is also beneficial in a meeting because they would recap what the presenter is speaking of in a visual manner. This is benefitial for visual readers who have difficulties staying focused on long pages of words.

heading-5: Typography
para-5: The font chosen for the book was ITC Avant Guarde, a san serif typeface used for the body copy. It is fun and casual, giving the book a relaxed tone. The typeface has a large family that varies in weight as well as a large x-height for good readability.  The typeface paired with it was Baskerville, a serif font used for the titles and spot images. The typeface carries a professional tone, to liven it up I chose to set the headlines in small caps. This adds a touch of quark to the copy.  Accenting colour of orange was also used through out the book to draw the eye to key information.
