title: Marketing Campaign Tiffany  Co.
heading-1: Challange
para-1: Over the years Tiffany and Co. has kept a fairly consistent marketing campaign. I wanted to create a marketing plan to expand their clientele into a new market they had yet to explore.  I chose to stay with the ideal of elegance and romance that the company is known for with the focus being on every day romance. I wanted the brand to be easily incorporated into peoples lives, that it was more then a gift is was a basis to start your life around. 
heading-2: Campaign
para-2: Research shows that the purchasing of rings is done prominently by males, making over 70% of the company’s customers. The campaign slogan is “We customize the ring. You customize the delivery.” The slogan is simple, yet still offers both a service and benefit. With the help of Tiffany’s craftsmen, not only will you receive a customized ring made just for your significant other, you carry the ability to create and present that cherished moment in which ever way you deem most fitting. 
heading-3: Imagery
para-3: The images used for the campaign are all in black and white. This creates unity, linking the campaign to past marketing themes. The images are of various proposals, from the beach asking through a shell, a cozy night in with a game of scrabble and finally a fortune cookie with the best fortune they could ever receive. The settings are all of commonly used romantic choices people are drawn to while proposing.

heading-4: Typography
para-4: The font chosen was one of simplicity and elegance. Baskerville regular is the font used through the campaign, it hold a professional tone while still possessing significant readability even at a small point size. Since the campaign will be displayed over multiple platform mediums with a variety of sizes, having a font that would be visible at multiple sizes was critical to pass the message across. The serif font not only relates to past Tiffany & Co. campaigns, blending similarities with past campaigns but also references the logo’s font creating a unity on the page. With its thin font weight, it has a delicate appearance. Italics were also used to add empathies on key words to draw the reader’s attention and break up the text.
heading-5: Design Considerations
para-5: A pop of colour was added to the design to allow it to stand out from others. The blue bar ties in Tiffany’s branded colour, it is almost as iconic and known with the brand as the logo itself. A thin, simple half a point border was used around the design, encompassing the artwork and adding that finishing touch, binding all the elements together. Since the campaign focuses on a more minimalistic design, the border not only creates boundaries for the art, separating it from others on a page, but it also adds a hint of decoration making the add more dynamic.
