title: UI/UX Design- Bar Buddy
heading-1: Concept
para-1: The app is created for people who want to go out and have a good time. Now a days, many people dread going out to bars and clubs in fear of being harassed or an incident occurring where they do not feel safe. Bar Buddy is an app targeted towards giving people that VIP experience, with the touch of a button you can have security in no time and even check in with your friends to make sure everyone is all right.  
heading-2: Target Audiance
para-2: The target audience for the app is primarily bar patrons who want to ensure the safety of their friends and theirselves throughout the night. The app is directed to those who do not feel safe going out on their own and want extra protection to have a carefree, fun time. The secondary audience is club owners, those who want to minimize the fights and lawsuits that may come with running a bar, as well ensure their clients are having a good time and want to return again. 
heading-3: Pain Points
para-3: Some of the pain points bar buddy would help relieve would be for clients who are not being able to enter the club because they had not signed up for guest list, causing them to wait outside. The app is also targeted to stop people from dressing how they feel in order to minimize the “appeal” you give off to others in order to not be harassed throughout the night. With the security feature; getting approached by people who are not taking no for an answer will no longer be a problem.

heading-4: How it works
para-4: Bar Guard is a security app created for the bar or club that puts you in direct contact with security at any sign of a problem. It allows the user to discretely press a button alerting bouncers to a problem in that area. With a GPS tracker and wifi signals placed throughout the room, the app alerts staff to your direct location in the room. Whether a fight broke out, someone will not take no for an answer or medical assistance is needed; Bar Guard will instantly notify staff to any problems as well as call in for authorities if the user deems necessary. All the user needs to do is sign in upon arriving at the venue, giving their name and the app tracks your arrival and departure through out the night. You can set alert times for check-ins, a simple notification pops up on the screen asking if you are safe.
heading-5: Design Considerations
para-5: The interface of the application was kept large and clean. Since may of the users will be intoxicated when using the app, the navigation had to be clear and straightforward with minimal words. With large buttons to press you’ll have no issue discreetly alerting security without causing a scene. The colours were kept cool and dark, mimicking the chique and glamorous experience you get from going to a club. The theme represents the good time the club offers. The interface is very similar to that of most IOS devices, allowing even new users to become very similar to the application quickly.
