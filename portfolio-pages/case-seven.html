title: UI/UX Design- Mommy Tracker
heading-1: Concept
para-1: Mommy Tracker was designed for expecting or postpartum mothers who are looking to breastfeed. The app was created to help minimize some of the frustrations that come along with breastfeeding. Many times women are alone, often struggling with not having the correct practice or techniques, this leads to many mothers giving up out of frustration and embarrassment of failure. Mommy tracker was created with the idea of empowering women and helping along the way.  
heading-2: Design Considerations
para-2: The challenges faced when designing the concept behind the application was to create an interface for women. Many apps for expecting mothers are geared towards their babies, with pastel colour and children’s toys. The idea behind the design was to create a sleek and sophisticated design, allowing mommy’s to still view themselves as powerful women, not just mothers. I did not want the app to belittle the idea of breastfeeding; instead to celebrate the power and dedication it takes to do it.   
heading-3: Objective
para-3: The objective of the design was to help busy and tired mothers remember when they last feed their child and the amount, in order for them to track their process and child’s development through the journey of breastfeeding. The app tracks the data and records it allowing you to view it any time you want.

heading-4: Pain Points
para-4: Some of the pain points Mommy Tracker looks to solve are- forgetting to switch breasts; with the live timer a notification shows exactly when to switch breasts. Forgetting your last feeding time; with the daily tracker, your last feedings times are all neatly displayed in order. Remembering which breast you left off with; within the daily tracker it remembers which breast was last used, marked so by a left and right tag. Logging the feeding history; with the monthly planners Mommy Tracker stores all past data for you.
heading-5: How it works
para-5: The app opens up with the choice to create a new timer or browse your past feedings. To set a new timer, all you have to do is set your preferred time and press start. Once in the timer, you are able to see the reaming time with a numbered count down, as well as a visual reminder. Depending on how long the feeding is set for intervals appear to indicate to switch breasts. If you need to stop at any point in the feeding, just press stop and your data will automatically become stored in the history. To check your history you can easily navigate between views of daily feeding times to a monthly calendar. You can even compare selected dates to view as a line graph for visual display.
