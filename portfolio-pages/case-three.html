title: Hand-Made Typography Book
heading-1: Concept
para-1: Within my quote book, I wanted to experiment with how the reader’s perspective can be changed and altered depending on how the information is displayed and given to them. Tone of voice is very powerful, as it the way you display something. I chose current world issues, ones that you would not typically bring up at family gatherings, or topics you would shy from during social events. I took shocking and powerful articles and set them in a “feminine” and “non-offensive” tone. 
heading-2: Craftsmanship 
para-2: To highlight key words, the quotes were set in a hand made typeface. Each one crated by delicate hands to give it a natural look. Each letter was set up with positing of flowers, bending of the letters and the touchups that came with them. In total the flowers took over five hours to complete. 
heading-3: Grid
para-3: I used a six-column gird for the layout, choosing to center my quotes like a poem on the left side utilizing the white space it created as a frame. On the left side a two column span grid was used for the body copy, while the authors name and the publication it was published in are colored pulling shades from the flowers themselves. The top half of the right pages was left bare of body copy to help balance out the minimalistic quote side.

heading-4: Approach
para-4: My approach to this topic was to use wire and flowers to create a natural and decorative flower font, one where the font looked as if it were growing on vines. I chose soft pastel colours, reds, pinks and whites; ones that would further reassure the calm and lighthearted tone I was trying to set. The imagery created is delicate and polished, a far cry from the words written within them. To pair with the hand made flower type, I used a curvy serif font, one with a large family and multiple font weight to break up the text. Alternating between italic, regular and bold font creates depth design to the piece.
heading-5: Experience
para-5: One experience I learned while creating handmade type is that creating something with your hands will never be perfect in comparison to digital type. A great designer is able to pick the differences and use them to balance off the computer set type. The key to making a good layout when merging the two is choosing typefaces that work well and contrast one another. The main lesson I learned is that it is not easy, especially when you are striving for perfection. Those who think they can bang off a handmade piece in an afternoon are wrong. The process behind this is long and time consuming. One tip I wish I had known would be to have put the flower type on a brighter background, one that was not so similar to the colour of the flowers. This would have made my photoshopping job a million times easier and two weeks shorter.
