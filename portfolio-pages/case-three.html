title: Marketing Campaign Tiffany  Co.
heading-1: Theme
para-1: I chose to create a campaign with the ideal of elegance and romance. Research shows that the purchase of engagement rings is done predominantly by males, with over 70% making up Tiffany’s consumers. The campaign was created to reach a target audience of both males and females; the focus of the design is based on every day romance and proposals. There is a large amount of pressure placed on proposals in society, with the outcome of having a grand and lavish event. Individuals spend countless weeks planning in advance to ensure a flawless proposal, and the campaign focuses on displaying how Tiffany  Co. will help make your perfect dream become a reality.  The campaign slogan is “We customize the ring. You customize the delivery.” The slogan is quite simple, while still offering both a service and a benefit. With the help of Tiffany’s craftsmen, not only will you receive a customized ring specifically for your significant other, you also possess the ability to create and present that cherished moment in whichever way you deem most fitting. 
heading-2: Typography
para-2: The design of the campaign truly reflects the audience it is reaching. The font chosen was one of simplicity and elegance. Baskerville regular is the font used through the campaign, it hold a professional tone while still possessing significant readability even at a small point size. Since the campaign will be displayed over multiple platform mediums with a variety of sizes, having a font that would be visible at multiple sizes was critical to pass the message across. The serif font not only relates to past Tiffany  Co. campaigns, blending similarities with past campaigns but also references the logo’s font creating a unity on the page. With its thin font weight, it has a delicate appearance. Italics were also used to add empathies on key words to draw the reader’s attention and break up the text. The copy is all in black giving the artwork a bold and unified feeling since it references to the images. 
heading-3: Application
para-3: The advertisements are broken up into three main sections, one of the slogan and the body copy, the dominant image telling the story, as well as the logo. A pop of colour was added to the design to allow it to stand out from others. The blue bar most commonly placed at the bottom of the design encompasses the logo, also tying in the Tiffany blue branded colour. The colour was chosen simply because it is almost as iconic and well known with the brand as the logo itself. A thin, simple half a point border was used around the design, encompassing the artwork and adding that finishing touch, binding all the elements together. Since the campaign focuses on a more minimalistic design, the border not only creates boundaries for the art, separating it from others on a page, but it also adds a hint of decoration making the add more dynamic.
