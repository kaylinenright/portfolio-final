title: Magazine Layout
heading-1: Concept
para-1: The concept of the magazine was to give it a professional and sleek tone. The magazine would be geared towards professional adults, possibly containing articles of informative articles for their lives or artistic outlets. The colour palette was restricted to one two colours, allowing the pastel green to soften the hard body of black copy.  
heading-2: Imagery
para-2: The imagery chosen for the magazine was all heavily saturated black and white images. The goal was to create a muted tonal magazine, one where the intricacy of the layout spoke for itself. The images are bold and dark, playing greatly on the thin, delicate weight of the font and white space. Just like the quotes, the images range in columns as well to break up the text and play with the grid.
heading-3: Technical
para-3: I wanted to push myself with this piece in terms of my InDesign skills. With all the text being set in one text frame, I had to rely on my paragraph and character styles to achieve the desired look. I wanted to mix simple three column design with quotes that span more to create a dynamic and interesting look.

heading-4: Typography
para-4: The typography chosen for the book is Bodoni Std, a serif font with a professional tone. Contrasting with the high x- height of the body copy, it makes the quotes and headlines pop off the page. This allows the titles and quotes to grab the attention of the reader and show the powerful aspects the quotes carry. The body copy is ITC Avant Guarde, a light and jolly san serif font. This pairs nicely with the headline, giving the book both a professional and fun feel. 
heading-5: Grid
para-5: The main grid of the book is a three column plan. Many of the elements within the articles break this grid in order to add white space to breath as well as make it visually interesting. With both the pull quotes and images spanning multiple columns it breaks up the long articles and reinforces main ideas to the reader.
