title: Package Redesign
heading-1: About the company
para-1: Manishewitz is an American based company, focused on bringing heritage filled kosher foods to the dinning tables of citizens all around the world. Using quality ingredients, they provide a healthy and environmentally friendly product. Offering kosher-based products, Manishewitz has thrived over the years in the Jewish community and those who seek a healthier meal alternative.  
heading-2: Design Considerations
para-2: Consumers shop primarily with their eyes, but for food their stomachs play a large part in the decision. Bringing in those appetizing and nutritious colours is the perfect strategy to attract consumers. The top of the packaging displays an image of a leaf; this is to represent all of the herbs and spices placed in their soup. 
heading-3: Environmental Waste
para-3: The redesign of the package is enormously more ecofriendly then its previous counterpart. Eliminating the full plastic tubing and replacing it with cardboard allows the consumer to recycle the product after consumption. The packaging can be printed on recycled paper to add an even greater economic saving.

heading-4: Colours
para-4: A distinct colour palette was chosen for the packaging, the colours themselves were taken straight from the soup mix itself. Bringing the natural colouring of the spices into the packaging shows how wholesome the product is, the quality produced from the company would rival that of how your grandmother used to make it. Warm tones were chosen for the colour palette to match the warm and filled feeling you receive after eating the soup. The colours themselves on the packaging all blend well together; the neutral earthy palette possesses a nice unity to the colours, allowing them to all work well together. The background colour to the package is soft beige allowing the dark font to really pop off the page and having great readability from the shelf. 
heading-5: Box construction
para-5: There is a die cut on the front of the box allowing the consumer to see and inspect the soup mix. The cut out is in the shape of a pepper, hinting at one of the main ingredients in the product. The container contains two sections inside the box; this is for portion control. For those who do not have large families 4 portions of soup can be very overwhelming and a waste, dividing up the box for two servings per section decreases lost food. The sections are simple to open with the perforated top, the sealed sections ensure product freshness and an easier pour. The top of the box is attached to the back of the product so one never has to fret over losing the lid among cooking, as well as easier clean up later on.
